# Simon

Simon game made with Arduino. It requires an Arduino One board or similar, an Arduino shield with some LEDs and buttons, a LCD display and a buzzer.

In order to run the program, you'll need to install some dependencies first. They're included in the "libs" folder, so you only need to install them in your Arduino IDE!

Just compile and run the code.
